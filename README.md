### ⚡ Problem
Urban environments are home to diverse wildlife 🐿️🦉🦝.  
Yet, **conventional recognition systems** struggle to identify species in **chaotic cityscapes**, causing:
- ❌ Overlooked species in city planning
- ❌ Weak urban–wildlife preservation
- ❌ Misunderstanding of animal behavior in cities

### 💡 Solution
We built an **AI-driven image recognition system** trained on **urban wildlife datasets** (annotated by specialists).  
It leverages **CNNs (ResNet-50)** to classify species with **high accuracy**, even in **complex urban environments**.

✅ Recognizes 150+ species  
✅ Continuously adapts with new data  
✅ Supports urban planning, research, and public awareness
